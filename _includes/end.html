        <h1>Ethical ads help keep the internet free and open.</h1>
        <p>I understand that ads can be annoying. But then again, think about how much content there is on this website. And you can read it all, for free. I could put up a paywall. I could ask for your credit card, I could charge you a monthly fee. But I want to keep learning to code free and open. I want to democratize one of the most important skills in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>I've put hundreds of hours into Code The Web, all in my own time, so you can enjoy these articles. I think it's fair that I get to make a bit of money from all this. I'm not greedy, or evil, or committed to plastering the web with ads. I just want to be able to keep these tutorials open to <i>anyone</i>, and be able to spend the time it takes to write each one. Now, is that ad in the corner worth it to keep web development free and open?</p>
        <p>In addition, I only promote stuff that I think will be helpful to you as a person learning web development (including free stuff) &mdash; so you might actually like what the ads are for! <i>*gasps*</i></p>
