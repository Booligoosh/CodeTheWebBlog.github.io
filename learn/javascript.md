I have written some of the prerequisites, though:

# Prerequisites
These are optional but recommended. In tutorials, I might build on what's covered here. I'd also recommed the set-up tutorial so you are writing and running your code in the same way as I am.
## How to learn a programming language
[How to learn web development][p1]

## Background knowledge
[How the internet works][p2]

## Set-up
[Practice web development on your computer][p3]

# Other resources you may find useful
These are just other articles I have written about stuff that isn't programming, but will help you along your web development journey.
