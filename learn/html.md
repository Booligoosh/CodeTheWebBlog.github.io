I've written many tutorials on HTML. As I want to make them easy to learn from, I've complied a list of which posts to check out in what order if you want to learn HTML. If you want to know more about Code The Web, check out the [welcome post][welcome].

# Prerequisites
These are optional but recommended. In tutorials, I might build on what's covered here. I'd also recommed the set-up tutorial so you are writing and running your code in the same way as I am. Or, you can just **[skip to the tutorials](#tutorials)**.
## How to learn a programming language
[How to learn web development][p1]

## Background knowledge
[How the internet works][p2]

## Set-up
[Practice web development on your computer][p3]

# Tutorials
I make a new tutorial at least once a week. Over time, this list will grow. Once you have finished learning HTML, you can move on to [CSS][css].
1. [HTML syntax][t1]
2. [The structure of an HTML document][t2]
3. [Basic types of HTML tags][t3]
4. [Links, images and about file paths][t4]
5. [Wrapping and grouping HTML elements][t5]
6. [Lists and navigation in HTML][t6]
7. [How to create a full-page hero image (HTML & CSS)][t7]
