I've written many tutorials on HTML. As I want to make them easy to learn from, I've complied a list of which posts to check out in what order if you want to learn HTML. If you want to know more about Code The Web, check out the [welcome post][welcome].

# Prerequisites
These are optional but recommended. In tutorials, I might build on what's covered here. I'd also recommed the set-up tutorial so we are on the same page.
## How to learn a programming language
[How to learn web development][how-to-learn-web-development]

## Background knowledge
[How the internet works][how-the-internet-works]

## Set-up
[Practice web development on your computer][web-development-on-your-computer]

# Tutorials
I make a new tutorial at least once a week. Over time, this list will grow. Once I have finished doing HTML, I will move on to [CSS][css].
1. [HTML syntax][html-syntax]
